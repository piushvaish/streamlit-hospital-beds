(I have stopped running of the application to save cost. Please contact me and I will re-deploy the application)

### Main Description
Application to help decision-makers optimise the distribution of beds for COVID-19 patients. It effectively informs planning, resource allocation, and mitigate the overcrowding of hospitals.

Data includes the numbers of licensed beds, staffed beds, ICU beds, and the bed utilization rate for the hospitals in the United States. The date of last update received from each hospital may be varied.

### Algorithm : Self_organizing Maps
Self Organizing Map(SOM) is an unsupervised neural network machine learning technique. SOM is used when the dataset has a lot of attributes because it produces a low-dimensional, most of times two-dimensional, output. The output is a discretised representation of the input space called map. Reference
